# Shell Scripting

Once you're comfortable with the Linux terminal, the next step is automating repetitive tasks. Shell scripts let you combine commands into reusable programs that save time and reduce human error.

## What Is Shell Scripting?

A shell script is a file containing a series of commands that the shell executes in sequence. Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is the most common shell on Linux systems. Writing Bash scripts is how you automate system administration, deployments, and data processing tasks.

## Why It Matters

Automation is at the heart of DevOps and infrastructure work. Before you use tools like Terraform or GitHub Actions, you need to understand the scripting fundamentals they're built on. Shell scripts appear in CI/CD pipelines, container entrypoints, cron jobs, and deployment workflows.

## What You'll Learn

- Variables and environment variables
- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`, `case`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `until`)
- Functions and script organization
- Pipes and redirects (`|`, `>`, `>>`, `<`)
- Exit codes and error handling
- Scheduling tasks with `cron`

## Prerequisites

Complete [Linux](/learn/foundations/linux/linux/) and [Text Editing](/learn/foundations/text-editing/text-editing/) first.

## Next Step

Continue to [Programming](/learn/foundations/programming/programming/) to learn Python, the general-purpose language used across infrastructure, automation, and data work.
