# Version Control

Every piece of code, configuration, and infrastructure definition should be tracked in version control. Git is the standard tool, and GitHub is the most widely used platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.

## What Is Version Control?

Version control tracks changes to files over time, letting you revert to previous versions, compare changes, and collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work. Git is a distributed version control system — every contributor has a full copy of the repository history.

## Why It Matters

Infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes manifests, Dockerfiles — all of these live in Git repositories. Understanding Git is essential for collaboration, code review, and maintaining a reliable history of every change to your systems.

## What You'll Learn

- Creating and cloning repositories
- Staging, committing, and viewing history
- Branching and merging strategies
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Pull requests and code review on GitHub
- GitHub workflows and collaboration patterns
- `.gitignore` and repository hygiene
