# Programming

Shell scripts handle system tasks well, but larger automation, tooling, and infrastructure projects call for a general-purpose programming language. Python is the most widely used language in infrastructure, DevOps, and data engineering.

## What Is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and broad ecosystem. It's used for automation scripts, CLI tools, web APIs, infrastructure management (Ansible, Pulumi), and machine learning.

## Why It Matters

Python appears everywhere in modern infrastructure: writing Lambda functions, building CLI tools, scripting cloud API interactions, processing data, and extending CI/CD pipelines. Understanding Python gives you access to thousands of libraries and frameworks that accelerate your work.

## What You'll Learn

- Python syntax and basic data types
- Data structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
- Functions and modules
- File I/O and working with JSON/YAML
- Error handling with try/except
- Virtual environments and `pip` package management
- Writing and running Python scripts

## Prerequisites

Complete [Shell Scripting](/learn/foundations/shell-scripting/shell-scripting/) first.

## Next Step

Continue to [Version Control](/learn/foundations/version-control/version-control/) to learn Git and GitHub — the tools every team uses to collaborate on code.
