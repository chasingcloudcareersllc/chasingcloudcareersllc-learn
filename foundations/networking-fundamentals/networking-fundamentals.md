# Networking Fundamentals

Computers don't exist in isolation. Networking is how they communicate, whether that's two containers on the same host or services spread across multiple cloud regions.

## What Is Networking?

Networking is the practice of connecting computers so they can exchange data. This involves protocols (agreed-upon rules for communication), addressing (how to find a specific machine), and routing (how data travels from point A to point B).

## Why It Matters

Cloud infrastructure, container networking, load balancers, DNS configuration, VPNs, and firewalls all rely on networking fundamentals. When something breaks in production, the issue is often networking. Understanding these concepts is critical for troubleshooting and architecture decisions.

## What You'll Learn

- IP addressing (IPv4 and IPv6) and subnetting
- TCP vs UDP and when each is used
- DNS: how domain names resolve to IP addresses
- HTTP/HTTPS: the protocol of the web
- Ports and sockets
- Firewalls and network security basics
- SSH: secure remote access

## Prerequisites

Complete [Linux](/learn/foundations/linux/linux/) and [Shell Scripting](/learn/foundations/shell-scripting/shell-scripting/) first.

## Next Step

Continue to [CI/CD](/learn/foundations/cicd/cicd/) to learn how to automate testing and deployment with GitHub Actions.
