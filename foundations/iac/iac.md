# Infrastructure as Code

Clicking through cloud consoles to create resources doesn't scale. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) lets you define your entire infrastructure in configuration files, track changes in version control, and provision environments reproducibly.

## What Is Infrastructure as Code?

IaC is the practice of managing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual processes. Terraform by HashiCorp is the most widely adopted IaC tool, supporting AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and hundreds of other providers through a single workflow.

## Why It Matters

IaC is how teams manage cloud infrastructure at scale. It enables reproducible environments, peer review of infrastructure changes, automated provisioning, and disaster recovery. If you work with cloud platforms, you'll use IaC daily.

## What You'll Learn

- What IaC is and why it replaces manual provisioning
- Terraform fundamentals: providers, resources, and data sources
- The plan/apply workflow
- State management and backends
- Variables, outputs, and locals
- Modules for reusable infrastructure components
- Working with multiple environments

## Prerequisites

Complete [Containers](/learn/foundations/containers/containers/), [Container Orchestration](/learn/foundations/container-orchestration/container-orchestration/), and [Version Control](/learn/foundations/version-control/version-control/) first.

## Next Step

Congratulations! You've completed the Foundations path. You now have the skills to move into any specialization — DevOps, Cloud Engineering, SRE, Platform Engineering, or AI/ML Infrastructure. Check back for specialization paths coming soon.
