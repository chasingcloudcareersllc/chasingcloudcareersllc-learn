# Getting Started

Welcome to **Chasing Cloud Careers**! The Foundations path is your starting point — a single, sequential learning journey that prepares you for any specialization in tech, whether that's DevOps, Cloud Engineering, SRE, Platform Engineering, or AI/ML Infrastructure.

## The Foundations Roadmap

This path covers 12 sections, each building on the last. Complete them in order:

1. **Introduction to Computers** — Hardware, software, binary, and how computers boot
2. **OS Fundamentals** — Processes, memory, file systems, users, and permissions
3. **Linux** — Ubuntu terminal, package management, file operations, and ownership
4. **Text Editing** — Vim modes, navigation, editing, and configuration
5. **Shell Scripting** — Variables, conditionals, loops, pipes, and cron
6. **Programming** — Python syntax, data structures, functions, and virtual environments
7. **Version Control** — Git and GitHub: repos, branches, merges, and pull requests
8. **Networking Fundamentals** — IP, TCP/UDP, DNS, HTTP, ports, firewalls, and SSH
9. **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions: workflows, triggers, jobs, secrets, and deployments
10. **Containers** — Docker: images, Dockerfiles, volumes, networking, and Compose
11. **Container Orchestration** — Kubernetes: pods, deployments, services, and kubectl
12. **Infrastructure as Code** — Terraform: providers, resources, state, and modules

## Why Foundations?

Every specialization in tech shares common ground. Whether you want to build cloud infrastructure, deploy machine learning models, or manage production systems at scale, you need these skills. The Foundations path gives you that shared base so you can confidently move into any career track.

## How to Use This Path

- **Go in order** — Each section assumes you've completed the ones before it
- **Practice** — Reading alone isn't enough; follow along with the hands-on examples
- **Take your time** — There's no deadline; learn at your own pace

## What Comes After Foundations?

Once you've completed all 12 sections, you'll be ready for specialization paths (coming soon):

- **DevOps** — Monitoring, observability, incident management, SLOs
- **Cloud Engineering** — AWS, Azure, and GCP services and architecture
- **SRE** — Reliability engineering, chaos engineering, capacity planning
- **Platform Engineering** — Internal developer platforms and toolchains
- **AI/ML Infrastructure** — MLOps, model serving, and data pipelines
