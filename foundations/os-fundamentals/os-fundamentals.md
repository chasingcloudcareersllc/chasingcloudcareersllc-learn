# OS Fundamentals

An operating system is the layer between hardware and the applications you use. It manages resources, enforces security, and provides the environment where everything else runs.

## What Is an Operating System?

The OS handles process scheduling, memory allocation, file system management, and hardware communication so that applications don't have to. Whether you're working with Linux servers in the cloud or managing containers on Kubernetes, the OS is always there underneath.

## Why It Matters

Understanding OS fundamentals helps you diagnose why a process is consuming too much memory, why a file can't be accessed, or why a container behaves differently from a VM. These are daily realities in cloud and infrastructure roles.

## What You'll Learn

- What an operating system does and why it exists
- Processes and process management
- Memory management and virtual memory
- File systems and directory structures
- Users, groups, and permission models
- How the kernel interacts with hardware

## Prerequisites

Complete [Introduction to Computers](/learn/foundations/introduction-to-computers/introduction-to-computers/) first.

## Next Step

Continue to [Linux](/learn/foundations/linux/linux/) to start working hands-on with the most widely used server operating system.
