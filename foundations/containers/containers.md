# Containers

Containers changed how software is built, shipped, and run. Instead of installing dependencies on a server and hoping everything works, you package your application and its entire environment into a container that runs the same way everywhere.

## What Are Containers?

A container is a lightweight, isolated environment that packages an application with all its dependencies. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host OS kernel, making them fast to start and efficient with resources. Docker is the most widely used container runtime.

## Why It Matters

Containers are the foundation of modern deployment. Kubernetes runs containers. CI/CD pipelines build containers. Cloud services run containers. Understanding Docker is a prerequisite for nearly every infrastructure and DevOps topic that follows.

## What You'll Learn

- What containers are and how they differ from VMs
- Docker architecture: images, containers, and registries
- Writing Dockerfiles to build custom images
- Managing containers: run, stop, logs, exec
- Volumes and persistent storage
- Container networking
- Docker Compose for multi-container applications

## Prerequisites

Complete [Linux](/learn/foundations/linux/linux/), [Networking Fundamentals](/learn/foundations/networking-fundamentals/networking-fundamentals/), and [CI/CD](/learn/foundations/cicd/cicd/) first.

## Next Step

Continue to [Container Orchestration](/learn/foundations/container-orchestration/container-orchestration/) to learn Kubernetes and how to manage containers at scale.
