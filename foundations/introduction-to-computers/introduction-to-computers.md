# Introduction to Computers

Before you can manage servers, deploy containers, or build cloud infrastructure, you need to understand what a computer actually is and how it works at a fundamental level.

## What Is a Computer?

A computer is a machine that takes input, processes it, and produces output. Every server in a data center, every laptop on a desk, and every virtual machine in the cloud follows this same basic model. Understanding the building blocks — CPU, memory, storage, and I/O — gives you a foundation for everything that comes next.

## Why It Matters

Cloud platforms, containers, and orchestration systems are all abstractions built on top of physical hardware. When you understand what's happening underneath, you can make better decisions about resource allocation, troubleshoot performance issues, and understand why certain architectural patterns exist.

## What You'll Learn

- How hardware components (CPU, RAM, storage, I/O) work together
- The difference between hardware and software
- How binary and data representation work
- The boot process: from power button to operating system
- How modern computers execute instructions

## Prerequisites

None — this is where it all begins.

## Next Step

Continue to [OS Fundamentals](/learn/foundations/os-fundamentals/os-fundamentals/) to learn how operating systems manage hardware and provide the environment where all software runs.
