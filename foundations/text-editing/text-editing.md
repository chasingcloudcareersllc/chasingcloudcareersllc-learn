# Text Editing

When you're SSH'd into a remote server with no graphical interface, you need a terminal-based text editor. Vim is installed on virtually every Linux system and is the standard tool for editing configuration files, scripts, and code directly on the command line.

## What Is Vim?

Vim is a modal text editor. Unlike editors where you just type, Vim has distinct modes for navigation, editing, and command execution. This design makes it extremely efficient once you learn the fundamentals.

## Why It Matters

You'll edit configuration files on remote servers, make quick fixes to scripts, and modify system settings — all through the terminal. Knowing Vim means you're never stuck without an editor, regardless of what system you're working on.

## What You'll Learn

- Vim's modal editing: Normal, Insert, Visual, and Command modes
- Navigation: moving by character, word, line, and screen
- Editing: inserting, deleting, copying, pasting, and undoing
- Search and replace
- Working with multiple files and split windows
- Configuring Vim with `.vimrc`
