# Linux

Linux powers the vast majority of servers, cloud instances, and containers in production today. Working comfortably in a Linux terminal is a non-negotiable skill for any infrastructure or DevOps role.

## What Is Linux?

Linux is a free, open-source operating system kernel. Combined with a distribution like Ubuntu, it provides a complete environment for running servers, developing software, and managing infrastructure. Most cloud workloads run on Linux.

## Why It Matters

If you're going to work with cloud platforms, containers, CI/CD pipelines, or infrastructure as code, you'll be working in Linux. Being fluent with the terminal, file system, and package management is essential for every section that follows.

## What You'll Learn

- Navigating the terminal and running commands
- Package management with `apt`
- File and directory operations (`ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`)
- File permissions with `chmod` and `chown`
- User and group management
- Environment variables and the `PATH`
- Reading logs and system information

## Prerequisites
