# CI/CD

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code. Instead of manually running tests and uploading files, a pipeline handles it every time you push a commit.

## What Is CI/CD?

Continuous Integration means automatically testing every code change. Continuous Deployment means automatically pushing tested code to production. Together, they form a pipeline that catches bugs early and ships changes reliably.

## Why It Matters

Every modern engineering team uses CI/CD. It's how companies deploy dozens of times per day without breaking things. Understanding CI/CD pipelines is essential for DevOps, SRE, and any infrastructure role.

## What You'll Learn

- What CI/CD is and why it exists
- GitHub Actions: workflows, triggers, and jobs
- Writing workflow YAML files
- Using actions from the GitHub Marketplace
- Managing secrets and environment variables
- Build, test, and deploy pipelines
- Workflow best practices and debugging
